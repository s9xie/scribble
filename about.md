Hi There. This is Saining Xie.

I am a PhD student at [CSE Department](http://cse.ucsd.edu), [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Zhuowen Tu](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu). I obtained my bachelor degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2013.

My research interest includes machine learning (especially deep learning) and its applications in computer vision.

I did research internship with [LV group](http://www.lv-nus.org) at National University of Singapore in 2012. And most recently I spent my summer with [Media Analytics Group](http://www.nec-labs.com/research-departments/media-analytics/media-analytics-home), NEC Labs America. 

Welcome to my site and have a good day.
